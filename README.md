Not much content in this repo currently; although this will soon hopefully be a software based 3D graphics engine/renderer.
Current library/framework dependencies are: 
* SDL2
* eigen3
* fmt
* spdlog
* assimp

You should copy the Source/Assets folder into the folder where the Q3D executable is before running.
Controls:
* F1 - Log Frametime and Frames Per Second into console
* F2 - Toggle between render modes (FillAndWireframe, Fill, Wireframe)
* F3 - Toggle between cull modes (CullBack, CullNone)
* F4 - Toggle mesh normals visualization
